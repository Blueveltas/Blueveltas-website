                                    from that consent at any time. This may apply to marketing

                        Encryption provides a high level of security and privacy for your data. When you enter your data
                        in our platform we use strong encryption technologies (such as Transport
                        Layer Security) to protect your data during transmission from your devices to our servers. </p>
                    <p class="text-slate-400 max-w-xl mx-auto mt-5">For providing more trust and security we use digital
                        EV (Extended Validation) Certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities. You can see the
                        ‘Green Bar’ in the supported browser versions which confirms what all

                        designed with strict security requirements in mind before we even begin development. This is the
                        key to guaranteed protection and privacy of all data that our services handle and store, once
                        the service or new feature

                        which allows most of our services to operate without using your actual data. Instead of that,
                        our services use a system ID that can't be traced back to identify you. </p>

                        used for your data processing in secure data centres. Network access to this
                        equipment is isolated from the Internet. We use network segmentation for isolation of services
                        which need different levels of security from each other. In addition, we restrict logical access
                        to your data for our employees
                        on a "need to know" basis. So, only the personnel that really requires access to your data for
